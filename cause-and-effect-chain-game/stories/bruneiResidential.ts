export const BRUNEI_RESIDENTIAL_STORY = `
**Brunei Before the British**

In the 1800s, Brunei was a sultanate. The Sultan ruled with complete power.

Brunei was rich. It had valuable resources:
- Oil under the ground
- Timber from the rainforests
- Important trade routes

Many countries wanted to control these resources.

**Britain Arrives**

Britain was building an empire. They wanted to control trade in Southeast Asia.

Britain saw Brunei's wealth. They wanted it for themselves.

In 1888, Britain and the Sultan signed a treaty. The treaty said:
- Britain would "protect" Brunei from other countries
- Britain would "advise" the Sultan

But this was not the full truth.

**The Resident System**

After the treaty, Britain appointed a British Resident.

The Resident was supposed to only "advise" the Sultan. But in reality, the Resident made all important decisions:
- How to spend money
- Who to trade with
- What laws to make

The Sultan could not say no to the Resident's "advice."

The Sultan lost his real power.

**British Control**

Britain now controlled Brunei's economy. They:
- Took most of the oil profits
- Controlled all trade
- Made Brunei dependent on Britain

Brunei became a British Protectorate. This means:
- Brunei was NOT fully independent
- Britain controlled foreign policy
- Britain made the important decisions

This system continued until Brunei finally gained independence in 1984.

**Think About It:**

Was the Resident system fair?

Did the Sultan have a real choice when he signed the treaty?

How did this affect the people of Brunei?
