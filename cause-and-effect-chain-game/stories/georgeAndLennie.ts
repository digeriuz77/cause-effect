**The Farm Dream**

George and Lennie worked on a farm. They dreamed of owning their own farm one day.

Lennie was very strong but did not always understand his own strength. He loved soft things like rabbits and soft hair.

**What Happened**

Curley's wife was lonely. Her husband, Curley, was mean and did not talk to her much.

One day, she found Lennie alone in the barn. She talked to him. Lennie told her he liked soft things.

"You can touch my hair," she said. "It's very soft."

Lennie touched her hair. He liked it very much. He stroked it harder and harder.

"Stop! You're messing it up!" she cried. She tried to pull away.

Lennie panicked. He was scared. He held on tighter because he did not want to get in trouble.

"Please, stop!" she screamed.

Lennie put his hand over her mouth to make her quiet. He held too tight. He did not know his own strength.

She stopped moving. Lennie had accidentally killed her.

**George's Choice**

Curley found his wife. He was very angry.

"I'm going to kill Lennie!" Curley shouted. He got his gun. Other men joined him with their guns too.

George knew what would happen. The mob would catch Lennie. They would hurt him badly before killing him.

George found Lennie first. Lennie was hiding by the river.

"Tell me about the farm, George," Lennie said. "Tell me about the rabbits."

George talked about their dream farm. While Lennie looked at the river and smiled, George raised his gun.

"We're gonna have a farm," George said quietly.

Bang.

George shot Lennie. It was quick. Lennie did not suffer.

The mob arrived seconds later. They saw what George had done.

**Why Did George Do It?**

Was George angry that their dream was gone?

Or did George want to save his friend from a brutal death by the mob?

What do you think?
