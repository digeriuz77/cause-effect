**The Mystery of the Right Triangle**

Over 2,500 years ago, a Greek mathematician named Pythagoras noticed something special about right triangles.

**What is a Right Triangle?**

A right triangle has:
- Three sides (we call them a, b, and c)
- One 90-degree angle (a square corner, like the corner of a book)
- The longest side is called the hypotenuse (c)

**Pythagoras's Discovery**

Pythagoras tried an experiment:

1. He drew a right triangle
2. He built a square on each side
3. He measured the area of each square

**What He Found**

When he measured the areas, he discovered a pattern:

- Square on side a: area = a × a = a²
- Square on side b: area = b × b = b²
- Square on side c: area = c × c = c²

The amazing discovery:
**The area of square a + the area of square b = the area of square c**

**The Formula**

This can be written as: **a² + b² = c²**

**Why Does This Matter?**

This formula works for EVERY right triangle, no matter the size.

If you know two sides, you can always find the third side.

**Example:**

Triangle with sides a=3 and b=4:
- 3² = 9
- 4² = 16
- 9 + 16 = 25
- So c² = 25
- Therefore c = 5

This simple pattern has been used for thousands of years by builders, engineers, and sailors to solve problems!

**Try It:**

Can you see how building squares on the sides helps us understand the relationship?
